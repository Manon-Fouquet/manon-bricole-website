On October 2021 was the first run of the newly designed Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM) in Belgium.

The CRM is intended to foster investment in new capacities in order to ensure power system security of supply in the long term, especially since Belgium is considering to phase out its nuclear power plants and to increase the share of renewables in the grid in the electricity mix.

The goal of the CRM auction is to select capacity offers for delivery period Y+1 to Y+4: a (priced) demand curve was set by Royal Decree, and prequalified capacity holders were able to submit bids to the market (for existing or new capacity).
