slug: "TERRE"
summary: "TERRE is the european platform for exchanging replacement reserves in Europe, following the Electricity Balancing guideline. I was involved in the implementation and validation of the TERRE auction clearing algorithm, a MILP/MIQ algorithm whose purpose is to provide an optimal selection of offers to satisfy TSO needs according to several criteria. I also developped a fallback heuristic in Java, in case the optimization failed. (MILP/ MIQP/ Mosel/ XPRESS/ Jenkins/ Java / Docker / RabbitMQ / MongoDB)"
