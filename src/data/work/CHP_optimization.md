summary: "I developped a generic library for modelling Combined Heat and Power plants using MILP framework. This library was then used in Artelys Crystal EnergyPlanner to model the power plant of some of our customers. This thermo-economic model was developped in order to improve the bidding strategy on electricity market, while at the same time meeting all the physical constraints of the plant. I proposed a methodology for proposing offers to the market (MILP/ python)"
