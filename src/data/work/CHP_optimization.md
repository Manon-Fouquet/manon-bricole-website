title:  "Optimization of a CHP plant"
date:   "2022-09-15"
slug:   "CHP"
summary: "I developped a generic library for modelling a Combined Heat and Power plant using MILP framework. This library was then used to modelling the power plant of our customer (physical model and electricity markets) in order to improve its bidding strategy on the electricity market, while at the same time respecting all the physical constraints of the plant and satisfying the heat demand to the DH network. I proposed a methodology for proposing offers to the market (MILP/ python)"
