slug: "toilet"
summary: "Dry toilets are an efficient way to reduce water spillage. As I live in the countryside I have no trouble to make compost but the problem is of course different in cities. I have used a urine-separator sold by Trobolo, which has the advantage of limiting moisture and smells, as well as reducing the need for sawdust a lot."
