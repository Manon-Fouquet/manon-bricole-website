summary: "We installed a heating floor in our house using the Caleosol system: fiber wood insulation, PE pipes, aluminium reflectors and dry flooring using Fermacell boards. We put a wood looking tiling in the main room, and oak wood parquet in small rooms.
There are 5 pipes ciruits. Water in pipe is heated thanks to a water-air heat pump which has been installed by professionals."
